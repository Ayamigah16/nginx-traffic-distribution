# Nginx Load Balancer Configuration
# Algorithm: Weighted Round Robin
#
# Weighted distribution allows you to send more traffic to more
# powerful servers. Higher weight = more requests.
#
# Use Case: When servers have different capacities, gradual
# migration to new infrastructure, or A/B testing.
#
# Example: weight=3 means the server will receive 3x more traffic
# than a server with weight=1.
