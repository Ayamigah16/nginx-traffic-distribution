# Nginx Load Balancer Configuration
# Algorithm: IP Hash
#
# IP Hash uses the client's IP address to determine which server
# to route to. The same client IP will always go to the same server.
#
# Use Case: Session persistence, shopping carts, user sessions,
# or any application that stores state locally on the server.
# 
# Important: This doesn't work well with clients behind NAT or
# load balancers, or when client IP changes frequently.
