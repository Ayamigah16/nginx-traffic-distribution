# Nginx Load Balancer Configuration
# Algorithm: Least Connections
#
# Least Connections routes requests to the server with the fewest
# active connections. This is better for requests with varying durations.
#
# Use Case: Applications with long-running requests, websockets,
# streaming, or when backend servers have different capacities.
