# Nginx Load Balancer Configuration
# Algorithm: Round Robin (Default)
# 
# Round Robin distributes requests evenly across all backend servers
# in sequential order. This is the simplest and default algorithm.
#
# Use Case: When all servers have similar capacity and requests
# have similar processing requirements.
